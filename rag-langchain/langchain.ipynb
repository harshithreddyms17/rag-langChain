The main advantage of final access modifier is security no one can modify our classes, variables and methods. The main disadvantage of final access modifier is we cannot implement oops concepts in java. Ex : Inheritance, polymorphism.  final class : A final class cannot be extended or subclassed.  We ar e preventing inheritance by marking a class as final. But we can still access the methods of this class by composition. Ex: String class final methods:  Method overriding is one of the important features in java. But there are situations where we may not want to use this feature. Then we  declared method as final which will print overriding.  To allow a method from being overridden we use final access modifier for methods. final variables : If a variable is declared as final ,it behaves like a constant . We cannot modify the value of final variable. Any attempt to modify the final variable results in compilation error. The error is as follows “final variable cannot be assigned.”   49)          Explain about abstract classes in java? Sometimes we may come across a situation where we cannot provide implementation  to all the methods in a class. We want to leave the implementation to a class that extends it. In such case we declare a class as abstract.To make a class abstract we use key word abstract. Any class that contains one or more abstract methods is declared as abstract. If we don’t declare class as abstract which contains abstract methods we get compile time error. We get the following error. “The type <class-name> must be an abstract class to define abstract methods.” Signature ; abstract class <class-name> { } For example if we take a vehicle class we cannot provide implementation to it because there may be two wheelers , four wheelers etc. At that moment we make vehicle class abstract. All the common features of vehicles are declared as abstract methods in vehicle class. Any class which extends vehicle will provide its  method implementation. It’s the responsibility of subclass to provide implementation. The important features of abstract classes are : 1)    Abstract classes cannot be instantiated. 2)    An abstract classes contains abstract methods, concrete methods or both. 3)    Any class which extends abstract class must override all methods of abstract class. 4)    An abstract class can contain either 0 or more abstract methods.

In C++ we have access specifiers as public,private,protected and default and access modifiers as static, final. But there is no  such divison of access specifiers and access modifiers in java.

We can use only two access modifiers for class public and default. public: A class with public modifier can be visible 1)    In the same class 2)    In the same package subclass 3)    In the same package nonsubclass 4)    In the different package subclass 5)    In the different package non subclass.   default :  A class with default modifier can be accesed 1)    In the same class 2)    In the same package subclass 3)    In the same package nonsubclass 4)    In the different package subclass 5)    In the different package non subclass. 46)    Explain what access modifiers can be used for methods?

The main advantage of final access modifier is security no one can modify our classes, variables and methods. The main disadvantage of final access modifier is we cannot implement oops concepts in java. Ex : Inheritance, polymorphism.  final class : A final class cannot be extended or subclassed.  We ar e preventing inheritance by marking a class as final. But we can still access the methods of this class by composition. Ex: String class final methods:  Method overriding is one of the important features in java. But there are situations where we may not want to use this feature. Then we  declared method as final which will print overriding.  To allow a method from being overridden we use final access modifier for methods. final variables : If a variable is declared as final ,it behaves like a constant . We cannot modify the value of final variable. Any attempt to modify the final variable results in compilation error. The error is as follows “final variable cannot be assigned.”   49)          Explain about abstract classes in java? Sometimes we may come across a situation where we cannot provide implementation  to all the methods in a class. We want to leave the implementation to a class that extends it. In such case we declare a class as abstract.To make a class abstract we use key word abstract. Any class that contains one or more abstract methods is declared as abstract. If we don’t declare class as abstract which contains abstract methods we get compile time error. We get the following error. “The type <class-name> must be an abstract class to define abstract methods.” Signature ; abstract class <class-name> { } For example if we take a vehicle class we cannot provide implementation to it because there may be two wheelers , four wheelers etc. At that moment we make vehicle class abstract. All the common features of vehicles are declared as abstract methods in vehicle class. Any class which extends vehicle will provide its  method implementation. It’s the responsibility of subclass to provide implementation. The important features of abstract classes are : 1)    Abstract classes cannot be instantiated. 2)    An abstract classes contains abstract methods, concrete methods or both. 3)    Any class which extends abstract class must override all methods of abstract class. 4)    An abstract class can contain either 0 or more abstract methods.
