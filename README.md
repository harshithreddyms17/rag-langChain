# LangChain and Pinecone Integration for NLP

## Project Overview

This project showcases an integration of various tools for processing and analyzing text data. It uses advanced technologies to handle and query documents efficiently.

## Features

- **Document Processing**: Loads and processes PDF documents.
- **Text Analysis**: Splits text into manageable chunks.
- **Vector Database**: Uses Pinecone for storing and querying text data.
- **Language Models**: Utilizes pre-trained models for question answering and text analysis.

## Usage

1. **Load and Process Documents**: Load PDF files and prepare them for analysis.
2. **Query Text Data**: Perform searches and retrieve relevant information.
3. **Question Answering**: Use language models to answer questions based on the processed text.
